An>“An observed sample mean qualifies as a common outcome if the difference between its value and that of the hypothesized population mean is small enough to be viewed as a probable outcome under the null hypothesis.” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 184](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=202&annotation=4UIBZHXD))

>“An observed sample mean qualifies as a rare outcome if the difference between its value and the hypothesized population mean is too large to be reasonably viewed as a probable outcome under the null hypothesis.” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 184](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=202&annotation=KUDH4ZBK))

“The level of significance (α) indicates the degree of rarity required of an observed outcome in order to reject the null hypothesis (H0). For instance, the .05 level of significance indicates that H0 should be rejected if the observed z could have occurred just by chance with a probability of only .05 (one chance out of twenty) or less.” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 190](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=208&annotation=Y879RYE5))

One word of caution when you are finding the median for ordered qualitative data. Avoid a common error that identifies the median simply with the middle or two middlemost classes, such as “between captain and major,” without regard to the cumulative relative frequencies and the location of the 50th percentile. In other words, do not treat the various classes as though they have the same frequencies when they actually have different frequencies.

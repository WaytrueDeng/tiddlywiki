“If the mean exceeds the median, as it does for the infant death rates, the underlying distribution is positively skewed because of one or more scores with relatively large values, such as the very high infant death rates for a number of countries, especially Sierra Leone. On the other hand, if the median exceeds the mean, the underlying distribution is negatively skewed because of one or more scores with relatively small values.” ([⁨Witte⁩ and ⁨Witte⁩, 2017, p. 53](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYSEUUXR?page=71&annotation=AUM4U2AJ))

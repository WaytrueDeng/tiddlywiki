title: mean of the deviation not a useful measure
publish: true

because the sum of the deviation will equal to zero so the mean of deviation will not work, so we have to make the negative sign disappear, we can use  the [[mean_of_the_squared_deviations_called_variance]], but [[actually_standard_deviation_exceeds_the_mean_deviation]]

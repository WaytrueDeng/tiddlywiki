js class is a function but use the class keyword rather than the function one.So we can say that [[function_inside_class_are_all_method]]

the simple format can be descriped as

```js
class theClassName (
the funciton body tha descirpe the calss's properties and method

)
```

- [[Js_use_constructor_to_assign_properties]]

Itâ€™s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:
dada
- Evergreen notes should be atomic
- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
- Evergreen notes should be densely linked
- Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies
- Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience

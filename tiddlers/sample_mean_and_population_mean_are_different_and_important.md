title: sample mean and population mean are different and important
publish: true

For example, if the terms of the 20 U.S. presidents are viewed as a population, then 5.60 years qualifies as a population mean. On the other hand, if the terms of the 20 U.S. presidents are viewed as a sample from the terms of all U.S. presidents, then 5.60 years qualifies as a sample mean. Not only is the present distinction entirely a matter of perspective, but it also produces exactly the same numerical value of 5.60 for both means.

==This distinction is introduced here because of its importance in later chapters, where the population mean usually is unknown but fixed as a constant, while the sample mean is known but varies from sample to sample==

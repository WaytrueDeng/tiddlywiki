title: what's the meaning of the term mode, median and mean
publish: true
---

- they are three different measures of central tendency 
  => mode reflects the value of the most frequently occurring score
  => The median reflects the middle value when observations are ordered from least to most
  => The mean is found by adding all scores and then dividing by the number of scores.

>“Strictly speaking, an average can refer to the mode, median, or mean—or even to some more exotic average, such as the geometric mean or the harmonic mean” ([⁨Witte⁩ and ⁨Witte⁩, 2017, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYSEUUXR?page=72&annotation=W79E467F)) 🔤严格来说，平均值可以指众数、中位数或平均值，甚至可以指一些更奇特的平均值，例如几何平均值或调和平均值🔤

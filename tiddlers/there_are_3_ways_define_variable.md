title: there are 3 ways define variable
publish: true

- var has a function scope:

> If you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.
> 
> If you use var inside of a function, it belongs to that function.
> 
> If you use var inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.

- let has a block scope.

- const has a block scope and when you create it, you can not change it anymore

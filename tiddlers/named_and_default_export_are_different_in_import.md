title: named and default export are different in import
publish: true

- when you need to import a named export you must use `import {name1} from module one` format, you need to destruct it.
    
    => you should also notice that the name in import must be the same as the export when in named export
    
- you can use any name in import a default export, this give the power that you can use annoymous function and expression in export

when a outcome is one of many possible outcome coming from a repeated experiment the smaller variability can reflect a real difference 

>As described in later chapters, variabilities within groups assume a key role in inferential statistics. Briefly, the relatively smaller variabilities within groups in experiment B translate into more statistical stability for the observed mean difference of 2 when it is viewed as just one outcome among many possible outcomes for repeat experiments. Therefore, insofar as similar (but not necessarily identical) mean differences would reappear in repeat experiments, we can conclude that the observed mean difference of 2 in experiment B probably reflects a real difference in favor of the treatment. On the other hand, the relatively larger variabilities within groups in experiment C translate into less statistical stability for the observed mean difference of 2 when it is viewed as just one outcome among many possible outcomes for repeat experiments. Insofar as dissimilar mean differencesâ€”even zero or negative mean differenceswould appear in repeat experiments, we can conclude that the observed mean difference of 2 fails to reflect a real difference in favor of the treatment in experiment C. Instead, since it is most likely a product of chance variability, the observed mean difference of 2 in experiment C can be viewed as merely transitory and not taken seriously.

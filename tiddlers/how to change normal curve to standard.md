first we must know [[what is the difference of normal curve and standard normal curve]], and we use $\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ to make it standard. the mean become 0 and the standard deviation become 1. 

we know [[standard_deviation_formulas_are_different_in_sample_and_population]]

the $SS = \sum(X-\bar{X})^2$ so you divide by $\sigma$ then the standard become 1

title: actually standard deviation exceeds the mean deviation

>Strictly speaking, the standard deviation usually exceeds the mean deviation or, more accurately, the mean absolute deviation. (In the case of distribution C in Figure 4.1, for example, the standard deviation equals 1.77, while the mean absolute deviation equals only 1.43.) Nevertheless, it is reasonable to describe the standard deviation as the average amount by which scores deviate on either side of their meanâ€”as long as you remember that an approximation is involved.

>The most important spinoff of the range, the interquartile range (IQR), is simply the range for the middle 50 percent of the scores,the IQR equals the distance between the third quartile (or 75th percentile) and the first quartile (or 25th percentile), that is, after the highest quarter (or top 25 percent) and the lowest quarter (or bottom 25 percent) have been trimmed from the original set of scores.

most distribution dare spread more widely in their extremities than their middle, their IQR tends to be less than half the size of the range

title: mean of the squared deviations called variance

>Before calculating the variance (a type of mean), negative signs must be eliminated from deviation scores. Squaring each deviation—that is, multiplying each deviation by itself—generates a set of squared deviation scores, all of which are positive. (Remember, the product of any two numbers with similar signs is always positive.)Now it’s merely a matter of adding the consistently positive values of all squared deviation scores and then dividing by the total number of scores to produce the mean of all squared deviation scores, also known as the variance.

but the variance has a weakness, it's a square value for example a data collection of weight xx pound will become square pound. so to fix that we use [[standard_deviation_is_the_square_root_of_the_variance]]

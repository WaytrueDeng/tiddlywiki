title: what is the difference between histogram and  bar graph
publish: true
---

A bar chart and a histogram are both ways of displaying data, but they have different types and purposes. A bar chart shows and compares separate categories of items, like ice cream flavors or car brands. A histogram shows the frequency or distribution of ==quantitative data,== like test scores or heights. A bar chart has spaces between every bar, which can be rearranged, and each bar has the same width. A histogram has no spaces between the bars, which follow a fixed order, and each bar is proportional to the data. A histogram represents non-discrete series of variables, while a bar chart represents discrete variables¹²³. I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions..

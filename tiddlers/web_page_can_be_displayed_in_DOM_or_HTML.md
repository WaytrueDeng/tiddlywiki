- a web page has its raw text, but it also can be displayed as a DOM structure because [[DOM_just_like_the_abstruct_structue_of_html]]
    =>  mabye the DOM format is the mort important one because [[DOM_is_a_programming_interface]]

- we can use the browser’s develop tool to check the DOM of the web page
    
    => In firefox you need to enable the DOM in the tool’s setting

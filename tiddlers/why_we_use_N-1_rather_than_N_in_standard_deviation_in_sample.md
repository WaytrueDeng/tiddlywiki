title: why we use N-1 rather than N in standard deviation in sample
publish: true

if x bar is assumed, then we know the sum of deviation of left side and right side  equal to zero, If we have N sample  the last sample is determined by other all sample. 
>Assume that the five scores (7, 3, 1, 0, 4) in Table 4.3 are a random sample from some population whose unknown variability is to be estimated with the sample variability. To understand why n − 1 works, let’s look more closely at deviation scores. Formula 4.3, the definition formula for the sample sum of squares, specifies that each of the five original scores, X, be expressed as positive or negative deviations from their sample mean, X, of 3. At this point, a subtle mathematical restriction causes a complication. It’s always true, as demonstrated on the left-hand side of Table 4.5, that the sum of all scores, when expressed as deviations about their own mean, equals zero. (If you’re skeptical, recall the discussion on page 52 about the mean as a balance point that equalizes the sums of all positive and negative deviations.) Given values for any four of the five deviations on the left-hand side of Table 4.5, the value of the remaining deviation is not free to vary. Instead, its value is completely fixed because it must comply with the mathematical restriction that the sum of all deviations about their own mean equals zero. For instance, given the sum for the four top deviations on the left-hand side of Table 4.5, that is, [4 + 0 + (–2) + (–3) = –1], the value of the bottom deviation must equal 1, as it does, because of the zero-sum restriction, that is, [–1 + 1 = 0]. Or since this mathematical restriction applies to any four of the five deviations, given the sum for the four bottom deviations in Table 4.5, that is, [0 + (–2) + (–3) + 1 = – 4], the value of the top deviation must equal 4 because [– 4 + 4 = 0].

of cource [[you_can_directly_write_React_in_HTML]] , but it is ok for testing purpose, when we use React for production, we need to set up a React environment

you need npm and nodejs to set up react environment

for tutorial purpose, we choose the create-react-app framework to build our first react app

```sh
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

we can cd into the my-react-app and run npm start in it to serve our first simple website

in the above we use npx and npm command so [[what_is_the_npx]]

- A frequency distribution showing the total number of observations in each class and lower-ranked classes. showing observations standing . I think the [[what_is_relative_frequency_distribution]] is showing the percentage of the single class but the cumulative one showing its and its lowers', becaulse it has the lower we must have a method to order the data [[cumulative_frequency_data_must_be_ordered]]
- eg: the rank of the score of something like you have won 99% people... which is called percentile ranked

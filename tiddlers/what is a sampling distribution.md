- single most important concept in inferential statistics
- a frame of references for every outcome, among all possible outcome that could occur just by chance
- in order to use samping distribution
	- its mean
	- its standard deviation
	- its shape
	- all above can be invoked by population mean, population standard deviation, and the normal curve
- the sampling distribution of the mean refers to the probability distribution of means for all possible random samples of a given size from some population.(均值的抽样分布是指从某个群体中随机抽取一定大小的所有可能样本的均值的概率分布。)

就是从一个整体中取出若干个样本，每个样本的均值的分布

“Now z represents a variation on the familiar standard score, and it displays all of the properties of standard scores described in Chapter 5([[what is the defination of z scrore]]). Furthermore, like the sampling distribution of X, the sampling distribution of z represents the distribution of z values that would be obtained if a value of z were calculated for each sample mean for all possible random samples of a given size from some population.” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 185](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=203&annotation=RGPCUPN4))

“Abbreviated as H0, the null hypothesis becomes the focal point for the entire test procedure (even though we usually hope to reject it).” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 188](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=206&annotation=T7SRFXLR))

the null hypothesis asserts that, with respect to the national average of 500, ==nothing special== is happening to the mean score for the local population of freshmen. An equivalent statement, in symbols, reads
$$H_0:\mu=500$$
where $H_0$ represents the null hypothesis and μ is the population mean for the local freshman class.

The alternative hypothesis (H1) asserts the opposite of the null hypothesis.

“Regardless of its form, H1 usually is identified with the research hypothesis, the informal hypothesis or hunch that, by implying the presence of something special in the underlying population, serves as inspiration for the entire investigation.” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 189](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=207&annotation=54H3TL6F))

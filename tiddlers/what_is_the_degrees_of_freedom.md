>Degrees of freedom (df) refers to the number of values that are free to vary, given one or more mathematical restrictions, in a sample being used to estimate a population characteristic.


>The concept of degrees of freedom is introduced only because we are using scores in a sample to estimate some unknown characteristic of the population. Typically, when used as an estimate, not all observed values in the sample are free to vary because of one or more mathematical restrictions. As has been noted, when n deviations about the sample mean are used to estimate variability in the population, only n − 1 are free to vary. As a result, there are only n − 1 degrees of freedom, that is, df = n − 1. One df is lost because of the zero-sum restriction.

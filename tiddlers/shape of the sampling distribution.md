“Regardless of the population shape, the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean approximates a normal curve if the sample size is sufficiently large.” ([Witte and Witte, 2017, p. 176](zotero://select/library/items/ZCQCSGM8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4S8NXKZ6?page=194&annotation=CMVX7JHK))

>When the sample size is large, it is most likely that any single sample will contain the full spectrum of small, intermediate, and large scores from the parent population, whatever its shape. The calculation of a mean for this type of sample tends to neutralize or dilute the effects of any extreme scores, and the sample mean emerges with some intermediate value. Accordingly, intermediate values prevail in the sampling distribution, and they cluster around a peak frequency representing the most common or modal value of the sample mean, as suggested at the bottom of Figure 9.3.
